## Real-Time Messaging Fix - Socket.IO Implementation

### Problem
Messages were not being sent in real-time. Users had to manually refresh to see new messages. This was due to two issues:

1. **Missing Socket Emission**: Messages were only sent via HTTP API, never emitted via socket
2. **Late Socket Connection**: Socket was connecting too late or not at all

### Root Causes

#### Issue 1: No Socket Emission in sendMessage()
**Before:**
```javascript
// chat.service.js
sendMessage: async (roomId, senderId, message) => {
    const { data } = await api.post('/chat/send-message', {...});
    return data;  // ❌ Never emits via socket!
}
```

**Flow (Broken):**
- Frontend sends message via API ✅
- Message saves to DB ✅
- Backend receives NO socket event ❌
- Backend never broadcasts to other users ❌
- Other users don't receive message in real-time ❌

#### Issue 2: Socket Connection Timing
**Before:**
```javascript
// TrainerMessagePage.jsx
useEffect(() => {
    fetchCurrentUser();  // async, returns before socket connects
    
    if (currentUserId) {  // ❌ Still null here!
        socketService.connect();
    }
}, []);
```

**Timeline (Broken):**
1. useEffect runs immediately
2. fetchCurrentUser() is called (async, doesn't await)
3. currentUserId is still null
4. socketService.connect() is never called
5. User interacts but socket isn't connected yet

### Solution Applied

#### Fix 1: Add Socket Emission to sendMessage()
**After:**
```javascript
// chat.service.js
import socketService from "./socket.service";

sendMessage: async (roomId, senderId, message) => {
    // Send via API to save to DB
    const { data } = await api.post('/chat/send-message', {...});
    
    // Also emit via socket for real-time broadcast ✅
    socketService.sendMessage(roomId, senderId, message);
    
    return data;
}
```

**New Flow (Fixed):**
- Frontend sends message via API ✅
- Message saves to DB ✅
- Frontend emits via socket ✅
- Backend receives socket event ✅
- Backend broadcasts to all room members ✅
- Other users receive in real-time ✅

#### Fix 2: Connect Socket After Fetching User
**After:**
```javascript
// Both TrainerMessagePage.jsx and TraineeMessagePage.jsx
const fetchCurrentUser = async () => {
    const user = await authService.me();
    setCurrentUserId(user.id);
    socketService.connect();  // ✅ Connect AFTER user is fetched
};

useEffect(() => {
    fetchCurrentUser();  // Connect happens inside async function
}, []);
```

**Timeline (Fixed):**
1. useEffect runs
2. fetchCurrentUser() starts
3. authService.me() completes
4. currentUserId is set
5. socketService.connect() is called ✅
6. Socket is ready when user starts messaging

### Files Modified
1. `src/services/chat.service.js` - Added socket emission
2. `src/pages/trainer/TrainerMessagePage.jsx` - Fixed socket connection timing
3. `src/pages/trainee/TraineeMessagePage.jsx` - Fixed socket connection timing

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Trainer sends message → appears immediately on trainee screen (no refresh)
- [ ] Trainee sends message → appears immediately on trainer screen (no refresh)
- [ ] Check browser console for socket connection logs
- [ ] Verify Socket.IO handshake completes on page load
- [ ] Multiple messages sent quickly all appear in order
- [ ] Test on different browser tabs/windows

### Debugging Commands
Run these in browser console to verify socket is working:

```javascript
// Check if socket is connected
socketService.getSocket().connected  // Should return true

// Check socket ID
socketService.getSocket().id  // Should show socket ID (e.g., "abc123...")

// Listen for all socket events (for debugging)
socketService.getSocket().onAny((event, ...args) => {
    console.log(`Socket event: ${event}`, args);
});
```

### Expected Console Logs
**On Page Load:**
```
Current user: {id: 1, email: "trainer@example.com", ...}
Socket connected: abc123xyz
```

**On Select Trainee/Trainer:**
```
Joined room: 5
```

**On Send Message:**
```
Message sent in room 5 by user 1
New message received: {id: 1, room_id: 5, sender_id: 1, message: "Hello", ...}
```

### Technical Explanation

**Socket Flow (Now Complete):**
```
Sender                 Backend               Receiver
  |                       |                      |
  |-- API POST ----------->| Save to DB           |
  |                        |                      |
  |-- Socket emit -------->| Receive sendMessage  |
  |                        |                      |
  |                        |-- Broadcast ------->|
  |                        | newMessage event     |
  |<-- newMessage event ---|<-- newMessage event |
  |                        |                      |
```

Both HTTP (for persistence) and WebSocket (for real-time) are now used together:
- **HTTP**: Ensures message is saved to database (reliable)
- **WebSocket**: Broadcasts message instantly to all connected users (real-time)

### Performance Notes
- Socket connection is established once on page load
- Room joining is lightweight (just joining a namespace)
- Messages are emitted immediately without waiting for DB response
- DB save and socket broadcast happen in parallel

### Future Improvements
- Add message retry logic if socket broadcast fails
- Implement message queuing if user goes offline
- Add typing indicators via socket
- Implement read receipts
